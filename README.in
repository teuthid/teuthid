Teuthid is a free open source framework, which implements multilayer artificial
neural networks in C++ with support for both fully connected and sparsely
connected networks. 
Cross-platform execution in floating-point numbers are supported with more
range and precision than C's ordinary built-in types.
The framework is designed to support multi-core CPU/GPGPU computing platforms
based on OpenCL and using Boost, free portable C++ source libraries.

Teuthid was inspired by the project FANN (http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/).
Thank you, Mr. Steffen Nissen!

This is version @teuthid_VERSION@ of the framework. 
The sources are available from https://github.com/teuthid/teuthid.

== 1. PREREQUISITES ==

This project requires:
  * CMake v3.5.0 or higher.
  * GNU Make or equivalent.
  * GCC or an alternative, reasonably conformant C++11 compiler.
  * Boost C++ headers and libraries v@Boost_REQUIRED_VERSION@ or higher. 
  * [optionally] OpenCL library and OpenCL C++ bindings.

  
== 2. BUILDING ==
 
Tethid uses CMake build system. However, we have conveniently provided 
a wrapper configure script and Makefile so that the typical build 
invocation of "./configure" followed by "make" will work. 
For a list of all possible build targets, use the command "make help".

NOTE: Users of CMake may believe that the top-level Makefile has been generated
by CMake - it has not, so please do not delete that file.

Available CMake options for building the framework are:
  * BUILD_SHARED_LIBS - Build shared libraries. Default is ON.
  * BUILD_STATIC_LIBS - Build static libraries. Default is OFF.
  * BUILD_WITH_OPENCL - Build with OpenCL support. Default is OFF.
  * USE_BOOST_COMPUTE - Use Boost.Compute for OpenCL support. 
                        Option BUILD_WITH_OPENCL must be ON in this case.
                        Default is ON.
  * BUILD_TESTS - Build unit tests. Default is ON.
  * BUILD_DOCS - Build HTML documentation using Doxygen. Default is ON.
  * BUILD_EXAMPLES - Build examples. Default is OFF.

Special options for x86 and x86-64 architectures:
  * ENABLE_AVX_SSE - Enable AVX or SSE compiler options. Default is OFF.
  * ENABLE_AVX_SSE_FOR_TESTS - Enable AVX or SSE options for compiling unit     
                               tests only. Default is OFF.
  
  
== 3. INSTALLING ==

Once the project has been built (see "BUILDING"), execute "sudo make install".
