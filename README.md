#Teuthid#
**Teuthid** is a free open source framework, which implements multilayer artificial neural networks in C++ with support for both fully connected and sparsely connected networks. Cross-platform execution in floating-point numbers are supported with more range and precision than C++'s ordinary built-in types. The framework is designed with support for multi-core CPU/GPGPU computing platforms based on **[OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/)** and **[Boost](http://www.boost.org/)**, free portable C++ source libraries.
##Features##
* Multilayer artificial neural network libraries in C++11
* Versatile (possible to adjust many parameters and features)
* Designed with OpenCL support using [Boost.Compute](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/compute/) library
* Open source, but can be used in commercial applications (licenced under [LGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html))
